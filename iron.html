<b>Powers</b> : Tony's body had been enhanced by the modified techno-organic virus, Extremis, but it is currently inaccessible and inoperable.

<br><br>
<b>Weapons </b>: The Iron Man armor includes Tony’s primary energy weapon, repulsor rays, a powerful particle beam which is standard equipment in the palms of his armor; the repulsor ray can repel physical and energy-based attacks, traveling as either a single stream or as a wide-field dispersal. The armor has also been outfitted with pulse bolts (extremely powerful plasma discharges which grow in strength as they seek their target), sonic generators, explosive shell projectiles, mini-missiles, magnetic field generators and a laser torch built into the finger of Tony’s gauntlet. The armor’s surface can generate an electric charge to dispel attackers.
